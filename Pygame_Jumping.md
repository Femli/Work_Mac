# Jumping in Python

One thing that is cool about programming in general is that there are many ways to solve a single problem. If you enjoy creating or brainstorming ways to tackle a given problem, and have the patience to see it through, then you will enjoy this lesson.

Jumping is a classic mechanic to teach, because there are several ways to code it. We will look at two ways to code jumping into our pygame programs:
- Linear
- Non-linear

There is a general rule that most professionals and academics like to follow, and it's known as *Occam's Razor*. Basically, follow the path that **works** and is **most simple**.

## Linear Jumping

What does linear jumping mean? In this context, it refers to how fast you jump up and how fast you fall back down. Linear here refers to the constant rate of going up and coming back down; not to be confused with the path of jumping, that is a separate mechanic.

Here is a graph to depict the linear jumping mechanic:
